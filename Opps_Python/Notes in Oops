# Types of programming------
# 1. Imperative
# 2.Functional
# 3.Object Oriented

# 4 plars of program --- Encapsulation , Abstraction , Polymorphism , Inheritance


# What is Class ?------------------------
# A class is a blueprint for creating object.

# what is Object ?
# Object are instances of classes.

# -> Matlab seedhi bhasa mai ek class ka use krke uske bacche banana



# What is Encapsulation ?--------------------
# ->I programing , encapsulation is about keeping some information(data) safe and only letting it be changed or looked at in specific ways.



# What is Polymorphism ? ---------------------
# -> Polymorphism means having many forms.
# -> Matlab eak he cheez diffrent tasks perform kar paa raha hai.


# What is Inheritance ? --------------------
# -> when one class inherits some features from another class this phenomena is know as inheritance.
# -> eak class jab doosri class se cheeze transfer karta hai usko inheritance kahete hai.
# Ex - Parents - child


# What is Abstraction ? --------------------
# -> When we only see the essential part of our code and hides the rest is the process of Abstraction.
# Ex - Plug Board , Shipping Box(Amazome, Flipl kart)
